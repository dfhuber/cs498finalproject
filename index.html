<h2>What is the economic impact of manufacturing on the economy in US EPA Region 5?</h2>
<p>US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 5 includes Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Ohio, and Wisconsin.  To learn about the economic impact, the first scene reviews the number of establishments
by manufacturing sector. This is followed by reviewing the number of paid employees and the 
total payroll for employees by manufacturing sector.  Finally, further investigation can be done by 
state to see which manufacturing sector provides the most economic impact for the state.</p>

<h3>Data</h3>
<p>This project uses a public data set to determine the impact of manufacturing on the economy in the 
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 5. This dataset was downloaded from the 
US Census Bureau 2015 County Business Patterns data for Illinois, Indian, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, 
and Wisconsin (http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/navigation/1.0/en/d_program:BP)</p>

<h2>About the visualization</h2>
<h3>Hybrid structure</h3>
<p>This visualization follows the martini glass narrative structure.  The user follows a designated 
path provided by the author from this introduction page through three scenes.  The user then can 
explore the information by each state in EPA Region 5 by using the appropriate state button on the 
final scene page.</p>

<h3>Scenes</h3>
<p>This narrative includes this introductory page, followed by three scenes that have the same layout 
and style.  Each scene has a narrative and a chart.  The final exploration page continues to use the 
same defined styles, however, buttons were added at the top to provide parameters for the exploration 
of the states.  Upon selecting a state, three charts are provided with the same look and size as the 
first three scenes.</p>

<p>A simple cascading style sheet was used to have a consistent template.  It defines the font, 
text size, color, title, navigation placement and tooltip template.</p>

<h3>Annotations</h3>
<p>Tooltips are provided for every chart throughout the narrative.  When the viewer hovers over any 
bar in the chart, the bar changes color and the tooltip is shown with exact data for the bar. </p>

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p>The state parameter is provide on the fourth scene (exploration).  By clicking on the state button, 
three charts are displayed showing that states information.</p>

<h3>Triggers</h3>
<p>Triggers are provided for changing scenes by using the next or previous hyperlink.  When the viewer 
clicks a link, the view will be taken to the next or previous scene.</p>

<p>On the fourth scene (exploration), there are button triggers.  When the viewer clicks a state button, 
the view can see charts for that state.</p>
